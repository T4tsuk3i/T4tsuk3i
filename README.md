# Hey, I’m T4tsuk3i 👾

Turning fun stuff boring since forever — I automate anything that moves 🛠️.  
Into **cybersecurity** (but I don’t post tools — I’m not looking to become one).  
Fell down the rabbit hole of **LLMs**, and now I reverse-engineer them just to see what they're *not* supposed to do.  
Also, I cycle. A lot. And no matter how I crunch the stats, **Tadej Pogačar** still breaks my model. 🧠🚴‍♂️📉

> 💙 I care deeply about kids and work with NGOs like **[U&I](https://uandi.org/)** and **[Make A Difference](https://makeadiff.in/)**.

> 🐧 Oh, and yeah... I use Arch, _by the way_.

## 🔄 Fresh Start

This is a **new account** — just wanted a clean slate without clutter.  
Old ones had my real name all over them, and honestly, this feels better.

## 🔭 Currently Working On

- 🧠 Building a local AI assistant for my home —  
  Handles tasks, chats casually, and might roast me at 3AM like Neuro-sama if I let it.
